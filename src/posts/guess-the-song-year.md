# GuessTheSongYear 🎵

**A music quiz party game for Android** — watch a music video, guess its release year, compete with friends on the same device or over LAN.

No accounts. No ads. No tracking. Just music and guessing.

> 🛡️ **Development environment security verified:** 2026-07-28 — build machine hardened (UFW, fail2ban, tirith, key-only auth pending final step)

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. **Pick a difficulty** — Easy (1980–2010, with hints), Medium (1970–2024), or Hard (1960–2025). Harder = more points.
2. **Watch the video** — A YouTube music video plays and you listen (and watch, unless you toggle listen-only mode).
3. **Guess the year** — Type a year or scroll through the year picker. The closer you are, the more points you get.
4. **See the results** — After everyone guesses, the host reveals the answer with a leaderboard.

**Exact guess:** 50 pts + streak bonus · **Off by 1:** 30 pts · **Off by ≤3:** 20 pts · **Off by ≤5:** 10 pts · **Off by ≤10:** 5 pts · **Way off:** 0 pts, but the right answer stares you in the face.

## 👥 Multiplayer

Play solo or host a LAN party — everyone on the same WiFi can join:

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Host** | Press "Vert" (Host). The app shows your IP + a QR code. Friends scan or type it in. |
| **Join** | Press "Bli med" (Join). It scans your network automatically for active hosts — no manual typing needed. |
| **QR scan** | Press the QR button to scan the host's code directly with your camera. |

**Discovery is automatic.** As soon as someone opens the Join tab, the app probes `192.168.x.2–254` looking for hosts with a HELLO/ACK handshake. Usually it finds the host before you notice.

### Connection Types

- **WiFi** (TCP on port 8888) — the default, requires same LAN
- **TLS** (TCP on port 8889) — encrypted channel with SPKI certificate pinning, activated when the joiner scans the host's QR code
- **Bluetooth RFCOMM** — close-range fallback, no WiFi needed

Messages exchanged between host and joiners are **HMAC-SHA256 signed** using a per-session random key distributed at join time. Older unsigned clients are still accepted (backward-compatible).

## 📱 Features

- 🎵 **YouTube video via official Iframe Player API** — zero ToS violations, no API keys, no user login
- 🎵 **~40 music videos spanning decades** — from 80s classics to modern hits
- 🎯 **Three difficulty levels** with different year ranges and score multipliers
- 📊 **Streak system** — correct guesses build a streak for bonus points, wrong guesses reset it
- 🕹️ **Classic and Arcade local multiplayer** — either everyone guesses together or players rotate one turn at a time
- 👥 **Remembered party setup** — two to eight named players persist between games
- 🎚️ **Configurable song distribution** — choose pure random, modern-prioritized, or custom decade weights
- 📈 **Persistent player statistics** — review guesses, exact answers, and points from the toolbar
- 📐 **Responsive game surfaces** — 16:9 playback and adaptive spacing scale from phones to tablets
- 🔊 **Listen-only mode** — the video overlay with the video opens and manages YouTube externally
- 🌓 **Dark theme** with amber accent, Material3 design
- 🔤 **Norwegian ←→ English UI** — switch language from the toolbar
- 🚫 **Duplicate prevention** — songs you've already seen are avoided
- ⏭️ **Auto-skip** — embed-disabled videos skip silently to the next one
- 📱 **Min SDK 24** (Android 7.0) through **target SDK 37** (Android 15)

├── MainActivity.kt                Entry point, toolbar, difficulty & language switching
├── VideoPlayerFragment.kt         Core game: WebView YouTube Iframe API, guess engine, scoring
├── ScoreManager.kt                Points calculation, streaks, accuracy
├── Difficulty.kt                  Easy/Medium/Hard config (year ranges + multipliers)
├── GameSessionManager.kt          Session state for multiplayer
├── HostGameFragment.kt            Host UI: IP/QGSR display, player list
├── JoinGameFragment.kt            Join UI: LAN scan results, QR scanning, manual IP entry
├── Protocol.kt                    TCP message JSON protocol (10 message types)
├── HostGameService.kt             TCP server on port 8888 + TLS on 8889, HMAC signing
├── JoinGameService.kt             TCP client, LAN scanner, SPKI pinning, HMAC verify

### Security Features

| Layer | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Transport** | Optional TLS (`TLSv1.3`) with ephemeral RSA 2048 keys + self-signed X.509 cert per session |
| **Certificate pinning** | SPKI hash shown on host screen — clients verify it during TLS join |
| **Message signing** | HMAC-SHA256 on every message body, key shared in `JOIN_ACK` |
| **Fallback** | Plain TCP still available for backwards compatibility; unsigned messages still accepted from old clients |
| **CI** | `contents: write` permission scoped to release job only, not workflow level |
